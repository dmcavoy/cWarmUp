C Warm Up

This class was created for C practice.  It is a very simple
database which keeps track of a class of students. A user
answers a bunch of prompts to enter their class and then
gets a number of statistics at the end.

The user first gives the size of the class.  Then the
program creates an array of students, which the user
fills in one by one. Each student has an ID, name and grade.
Once all the students have been
entered the information of all the students plus the
grade distribution prints out.

Important: The program will only read one name for a student.
You can't enter someones full name.  For example you can enter
"Dani" but if you enter "Dani McAvoy" it will only read the Dani.

Also the program will only exit if you type 0 for the number
of students. Typing 0 anywhere else will not exit the program.

*RUNNING THE PROGRAM*
To run the program run make inside the folder cWarmUp and then that
will create a fill named GradeBook.  The command ./GradeBook will 
start the program.
